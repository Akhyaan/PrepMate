Basic terminologies
•Symbol - A symbol (often also called acharacter) is the smallest building block, which can be any 
alphabet, letter, or picture.
•Alphabet (Σ) : Finite, nonempty  set of symbols which are alwaysfinite.
•Examples:
• = {0, 1}: binary alphabet
• = {a, b, c, ..., z}: the set of all lower case letters
•The set of all ASCII characters
•String- A string is afinitesequence of symbols from some alphabet . A string is generally denoted 
aswand the length of a string is denoted as|w|.
•Examples:
•01101 where  = {0, 1}
•abracadabra where  = {a, b, c, ..., z}
Dr. Sri Preethaa K R / SCOPE/ VIT3

Theory of Computation
•Empty String: The string with zero occurrences of symbols from  and is denoted e or 
•Length of String: Number of symbols in the string
•The length of a string w is usually written |w|
•|1010| = 4
•|| = 0
•|uv| = |u| + |v|
•Reverse : w
R
• If w = abc, w
R
 = cba
•Concatenation: if x and y are strings, then xy is the string obtained by placing a copy of y immediately 
after a copy of x
•x = a

Theory of Computation
Example
•Number of Strings (of length 2) 
•that can be generated over the alphabet {a, b}:
-   -
                     a   a
                     a   b
                     b   a
                     b   b
•Length of String |w| = 2
•Number of possible Strings = 4
Therefore 
•For alphabet {a, b} with length n, number of strings can be generated = 2
 n
.
•Let Σ = {a, b} be an alphabet; then aa, ab, bba, baaba, . . . are some examples of strings over Σ.

string operations
Closure Representation
•L
+
: It is aPositive Closurethat represents a set of all strings except Null or ε-strings.
•L
*
: It is “Kleene Closure“, that represents the occurrence of certain alphabets for given language alphabets 
from zero to the infinite number of times. In which ε-string is also included.
•Let Σ = {a, b} be an alphabet; then aa, ab, bba, baaba, . . . are some examples of strings over Σ.
•The set of all strings over an alphabet Σ is denoted by Σ∗ .
L* = εL+

string operations
Example:
(a) Regular expression for language accepting all combination of g's over Σ={g}:
                                         R = g*
                               R={ε,g,gg,ggg,gggg,ggggg,...}
(b) Regular Expression for language accepting all combination of g's over Σ={g} :    R = g+
                               R={g, gg, ggg, gggg, ggggg, gggggg,...}
Example:
Input String: "GFG".
Σ* = { ε,"GFG","GGFG","GGFG","GFGGGGGGGG","GGGGGGGGFFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGG",...} 
•For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ ∗ = {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, . . .}.
Dr. Sri Preethaa K R / SCOPE/ VIT7

Languages
Language
A language is aset of strings, chosen from some Σ* or we can say-‘A language is a subset of Σ*‘. A language 
that can be formed over ‘ Σ ‘ can beFiniteorInfinite. Note : , |{ε}| = 1.
•A language is a subset of 
*
•Example of languages:
•The set of valid Arabic words
•The set of strings consisting of n 0’s followed by n 1’s
•{, 01, 0011, 000111, ...}
• The set of strings with equal number of 0’s and 1’s
•{, 01, 10, 0011, 0101, 1010, 1001, 1100, ...}
•Empty language:  = { }
•The language  consisting of the empty string
•Note:   
Example of Finite Language:

Language
Since languages are sets, we can apply various well known set operations such as union, intersection, 
complement, difference on languages. 
The notion of concatenation of strings can be extended to languages as follows.
1. The concatenation of a pair of languages L1, L2 is
L1. L2 = {xy | x ∈ L1 ∧ y ∈ L2}.
Example 2.2.3.
1. If L1 = {0, 1, 01} and L2 = {1, 00}, then L1.L2 = {01, 11, 011, 000, 100, 0100}.
2. For L1 = {b, ba, bab} and L2 = {ε, b, bb, abb}, we have L1.L2 = {b, ba, bb, bab, bbb, babb, baabb, babbb, bababb}.

Strings and Languages (5)
•Substring: any string of consecutive characters in some string w
•If w = abc
•e, a, ab, abc are substrings of w
•Prefix and suffix:
•if w = vu
•v is a prefix of w
•u is a suffix of w
•Example
•If w = abc
•a, ab , abc are prefixes of w
•c, bc, abc are suffixes of w
•Suppose:  S is the string  banana
•Prefix  :  ban,  banana
•Suffix  :  ana, banana
•Substring :  nan, ban, ana, banana
11

Basic terminologies
1.Since concatenation of strings is associative, so is the concatenation of languages. 
That is, for all languages L1, L2 and L3,
(L1.L2).L3 = L1.(L2.L3).
Hence, (L1L2)L3 may simply be written as L1.L2.L3.
2. The number of strings in L1L2 is always less than or equal to the product of individual numbers, i.e.
|L1.L2| ≤ |L1|.|L2|.
3. L1 ⊆ L1.L2 if and only if ε ∈ L2.
4. Similarly, ε ∈ L1 if and only if L2 ⊆ L1. L2.

Basic terminologies
1. Kleene star of the language {01} is {ε, 01, 0101, 010101, . . .} = {(01) 
n
 / | n ≥ 0}.
2. If L = {0, 10}, then L 
*
 = {ε, 0, 10, 00, 010, 100, 1010, 000, . . .}
Since an arbitrary string in L
 n  
is of the form x
 1 
x
 2
 · · · x
 n
, for xi ∈ L and
L
 * 
= [ n≥0  L
 n
, one can easily observe that L∗ = {x
 1 
x
 2
 · · · x
 n
 | n ≥ 0 and xi
 
∈ L, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
Thus, a typical string in L∗ is a concatenation of finitely many strings of L.
3. Note that, the Kleene star of the language L = {0, 1} over the alphabet Σ = {0, 1} is 
L ∗ = L 
0
 ∪ L 
1 
∪ L 
2
 ∪ · · · 
= {ε} ∪{0, 1} ∪{00, 01, 10, 11} ∪· · · 
= {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, · · · } 
= the set of all strings over Σ.

4. The positive closure of a language L is denoted by L 
+
 is defined as L 
+
 = Union of L

  where n>=1
Thus, L 
*
 = L 
+
 ∪ {ε}
Exercise :
1.The set of all strings over {a, b, c} that have ac as substring can be written as {xacy | x, y ∈ {a, b, c} ∗ }.
2.The set of all strings over {a, b} in which every occurrence of b is not before an occurrence of a.
3.The set of all strings over some alphabet Σ with equal number of a 0 s and b 0 s
4.The set of all strings over some alphabet Σ with no consecutive a 0 s.
5.The set of all strings over some alphabet Σ that have an a in the 5th position from the right

Basic terminologies
String Properties:
•P1 Recall that concatenation of languages is associative. 
•P2 Since concatenation of strings is not commutative, we have L1. L2 != L2. L1, in general.
•P3 L{ε} = {ε}L = L. 
•P4 L∅ = ∅L = ∅. ∅L = ∅ as well. 
•P5 Distributive Properties:
1. (L1 ∪ L2)L3 = L1L3 ∪ L2L3.
2. L1(L2 ∪ L3) = L1L2 ∪ L1L3.
•P6 If L1 ⊆ L2 and L3 ⊆ L4, then L1L3 ⊆ L2L4. 
•P7 ∅∗ = {ε}. 
•P8 {ε} ∗= {ε}. 
•P9 If ε ∈L, then L ∗ = L +.
• P10 L ∗L = LL∗ = L +.
